You can support the creation of content like Software Architecture Radio by becoming one of my patrons on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mattstine).

As I reboot the podcast, I'll be creating special benefits just for patrons, as well as allow those of you that support at certain levels to contribute to the direction of the podcast.

Thanks to everyone that's supported Software Architecture Radio even during its long hiatus!
