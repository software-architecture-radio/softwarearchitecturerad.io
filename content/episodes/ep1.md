My guest for this show is [Tim Berglund](http://timberglund.com/), Vice President of Developer Education at [DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/). We start by discussing the unique challenges of distributed systems for architects, eventually landing on the most important piece of distributed systems advice a software architect can receive. We then dive into types of distributed systems and how to build up one's skill set in this important area.
